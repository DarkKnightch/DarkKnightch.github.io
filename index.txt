Current approaches resort to preprocessing steps, such as interpolation and extrapolation, to handle irregular and off-grid measurements, which compromise the physical nature of signals and degrade the representation performance. To address this challenge, rather than utilizing discrete vectors, we introduce a Bayesian functional representation model that capitalizes on the continuous nature and rich expressiveness of Gaussian processes to facilitate interpretable and effective basis function learning.

}c:T692,The probability distribution of three-dimensional sound speed fields (3D SSFs) in an ocean region encapsulates vital information about their variations, serving as valuable data-driven priors for SSF inversion tasks. However, learning such a distribution is challenging due to the high dimensionality and complexity of 3D SSFs. To tackle this challenge, we propose employing the diffusion model, a cutting-edge deep generative model that has showcased remarkable performance in diverse domains, including image and audio processing. Nonetheless, applying this approach to 3D ocean SSFs encounters two primary hurdles. First, the lack of publicly available well-crafted 3D SSF datasets impedes training and evaluation. Second, 3D SSF data consist of multiple 2D layers with varying variances, which can lead to uneven denoising during the reverse process. To surmount these obstacles, we introduce a novel 3D SSF dataset called 3DSSF, specifically designed for training and evaluating deep generative models. In addition, we devise a high-capacity neural architecture for the diffusion model to effectively handle variations in 3D sound speeds. Furthermore, we employ state-of-the-art continuous-time-based optimization method and predictor-corrector scheme for high-performance training and sampling. Notably, this paper presents the first evaluation of the diffusion model's effectiveness in generating 3D SSF data. Numerical experiments validate the proposed method's strong ability to learn the underlying data distribution of 3D SSFs, and highlight its effectiveness in assisting SSF inversion tasks and subsequently characterizing the transmission loss of underwater acoustics.d:T856,@article{li2024learning,

}e:T49b,Accurately reconstructing a three-dimensional (3D) ocean sound speed field (SSF) is essential for various ocean acoustic applications, but the sparsity and uncertainty of sound speed samples across a vast ocean region make it a challenging task. To tackle this challenge, a large body of reconstruction methods has been developed, including spline interpolation, matrix or tensor-based completion, and deep neural networks (DNNs)-based reconstruction. However, a principled analysis of their effectiveness in 3D SSF reconstruction is still lacking. This paper performs a thorough analysis of the reconstruction error and highlights the need for a balanced representation model that integrates expressiveness and conciseness. To meet this requirement, a 3D SSF-tailored tensor DNN is proposed, which uses tensor computations and DNN architectures to achieve remarkable 3D SSF reconstruction. The proposed model not only includes the previous tensor-based SSF representation model as a special case but also has a natural ability to reject noise. The numerical results using the South China Sea 3D SSF data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.f:T679,@article{li2023striking,
